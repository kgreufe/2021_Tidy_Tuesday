## Get Data

```{r get data}
tt <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2021", week = 6)

hs_students_raw <- tt$hs_students

```

## Clean

Data adapted from this sheet:
https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_104.10.asp

```{r initial clean}
hs_students <- 
  hs_students_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # original d
  filter(!is.na(total)) %>% 
  select(-contains("standard_error")) %>% 
  # a few rows have footnotes in original data, which appear here at end of number (e.g., 19103 is year 1910 with footnote 3)
  mutate(total = parse_number(str_sub(total, end = 4L)))
```


```{r renames mutates}
hs_students <- 
  hs_students %>% 
  rename(year = total, 
         total = total_percent_of_all_persons_age_25_and_over, 
         white = white1, 
         black = black1, 
         asian = asian_pacific_islander_asian, 
         pacific_islander = asian_pacific_islander_pacific_islander
         ) %>% 
  # replace dashes with zeroes
  mutate(across(.fns = ~ if_else(. == "â€”", "0", as.character(.)))) %>% 
  # convert cols to numeric
  mutate(across(.fns = parse_number)) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>% 
  # convert percentages to be between 0 and 1
  # I'll leverage the scales pkg in plots to convert back
  mutate(across(where(is_double), ~ . / 100))

```

Data is split in interesting year intervals 

- By decade from 1910 to 1960. 1910, 1920, and 1930 are estimates from a reverse projection of 1940 census data on education by age. Other years are probably the data that were collected at the time of the census. 

- Every five years from 1970 through 1985. My guess is that the census bureau starting being able to collect, aggregate, and release more data around this time. 

- Starting with 1985 there is a row for every year (through to end of dataset in 2016)

To make comparisons easier, I'll filter down to just data from years 1985 forward (yearly data).


```{r filter >= 1985}
hs_students <- 
  hs_students %>% 
  filter(year >= 1985)
```

## Wrangle

Let's pivot longer for each of these variables so we can then plot them easier. 


```{r}
hs_students_long <- 
  hs_students %>% 
  pivot_longer(-year) %>% 
  filter(value != 0, 
         # We'll plot on the "asian" and "pacific islander" separately, so remove the combined total
         !str_detect(name, 'total_asian_pacific_islander')) %>% 
  filter(name != "total")

names_plot_display <- 
  distinct(hs_students_long, name) %>% 
  mutate(name_disp = str_to_title(str_replace_all(name, "_", " ")),
         name_disp = str_replace(name_disp, "Indian Alaska", "Indian /\nAlaska"),
         name_disp = str_replace(name_disp, "Race", "Races"),
         # create factor as same order as they appear in original data
         name_disp = factor(name_disp, levels = name_disp)
         )
  
hs_students_long <- 
  hs_students_long %>% 
  left_join(names_plot_display, by = "name")

```
